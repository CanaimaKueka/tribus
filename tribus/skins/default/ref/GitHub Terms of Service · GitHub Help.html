      <p>By using the GitHub.com web site ("Service"), or any services 
of GitHub, Inc ("GitHub"), you are agreeing to be bound by the following
 terms and conditions ("Terms of Service").  IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO 
THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU 
REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, ITS 
AFFILIATES AND ALL USERS WHO ACCESS OUR  SERVICES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT 
TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS "YOU" OR "YOUR" 
SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND USERS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
 IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE
 THE SERVICES. </p>

<p>Please note that if you are accessing any GitHub service in a 
government or public entity capacity, there are special terms that may 
apply to you. Please see Section G.17, below, for more details.  </p>

<p>If GitHub makes material changes to these Terms, we will notify you 
by email or by posting a notice on our site before the changes are 
effective. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service,
 including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to 
the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such 
changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review 
the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at: <a href="https://github.com/site/terms">http://github.com/site/terms</a></p>

<p>Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of
 your Account. While GitHub prohibits such conduct and Content on the 
Service, you understand and agree that GitHub cannot be responsible for 
the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to 
such materials. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.</p>

<h3>
<a name="a-account-terms" class="anchor" href="#a-account-terms"><span class="mini-icon mini-icon-link"></span></a>A. Account Terms</h3>

<li><p>You must provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and
 any other information requested in order to complete the signup 
process.</p></li>
<li><p>Your login may only be used by one person - a single login shared
 by multiple people is not permitted. You may create separate logins for
 as many people as your plan allows.</p></li>
<li><p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account 
and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or 
damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</p></li>

<a name="b-api-terms" class="anchor" href="#b-api-terms"><span class="mini-icon mini-icon-link"></span></a>B. API Terms</h3>

<p>Customers may access their GitHub account data via an API 
(Application Program Interface). Any use of the API, including use of 
the API through a third-party product that accesses GitHub, is bound by 
these Terms of Service plus the following specific terms:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You expressly understand and agree that GitHub shall not be 
liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or 
exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of 
profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if GitHub 
has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from 
your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the 
API.</p></li>
<li><p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may 
result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access
 to the API. GitHub, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or 
excessive usage of the API. GitHub will make a reasonable attempt via 
email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.</p></li>
<li><p>GitHub reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, 
temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof)
 with or without notice.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>An upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan will immediately bill you.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and

unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no 
exceptions will be made.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by
 taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all 
such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or 
state) taxes.</p></li>
<li><p>For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that
 you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next 
billing cycle.</p></li>
<li><p>Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features,
 or capacity of your Account. GitHub does not accept any liability for 
such loss.</p></li>

<a name="d-cancellation-and-termination" class="anchor" href="#d-cancellation-and-termination"><span class="mini-icon mini-icon-link"></span></a>D. Cancellation and Termination</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>You are solely responsible for properly canceling your 
account. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not 
considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time by 
clicking on the Account link in the global navigation bar at the top of 
the screen. The Account screen provides a simple no questions asked 
cancellation link.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>All of your Content will be immediately deleted from the Service 
upon cancellation. This information can not be recovered once your 
account is cancelled.</p></li>
<li><p>If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up 
month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not 
be charged again.</p></li>
<li><p>GitHub, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or 
terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of 
the Service, or any other GitHub service, for any reason at any time. 
Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or 
deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the 
forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. GitHub 
reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any 
time.</p></li>

<li><p>GitHub reserves the right at any time and from time to time to 
modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any 
part thereof) with or without notice.</p></li>

subscription plan fees to the Service, are subject to change upon 30

the changes to the GitHub Site (<a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>) or the Service itself.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p>We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you 
provide to the Service. Your profile and materials uploaded remain 
yours. However, by setting your pages to be viewed publicly, you agree 
to allow others to view your Content. By setting your repositories to be
 viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and fork your 
repositories.</p></li>
<li><p>GitHub does not pre-screen Content, but GitHub and its designee 
have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to 
refuse or remove any Content that is available via the Service.</p></li>
<li><p>You shall defend GitHub against any claim, demand, suit or 
proceeding made or brought against GitHub by a third party alleging that
 Your Content, or Your use of the Service in violation of this 
Agreement, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights
 of a third party or violates applicable law, and shall indemnify GitHub
 for any damages finally awarded against, and for reasonable attorney’s 
fees incurred by, GitHub in connection with any such claim, demand, suit
 or proceeding; provided, that GitHub (a)&nbsp;promptly gives You 
written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (b)&nbsp;gives 
You sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, 
suit or proceeding (provided that You may not settle any claim, demand, 
suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub
 of all liability); and (c) provides to You all reasonable assistance, 
at Your expense.</p></li>
<li><p>The look and feel of the Service is copyright ©2010 GitHub Inc.
