Tribus receive your information through our various web services, APIs and email notifications (the "<strong>Services</strong>" or "<strong>Tribus</strong>"). By using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, treatment, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

                                    <p><b>Information Collected Upon Registration:</b> {% blocktrans %}When you create or reconfigure a Tribus account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration.</p>

                                    <p><b>Additional Information:</b> {% blocktrans %}You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as a short description or a picture. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services. We may use your contact information to help others find your Tribus account.</p>

                                    <p><b>Tribs, Following, Followers and other Public Information:</b> {% blocktrans %}Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you Tweet and the metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, the Tweets you mark as favorites or Retweet, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from Tribus, but we generally give you <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/security">settings</a> to make the information more private if you want. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your public user profile information and public Tweets may be searchable by search engines and are immediately delivered via SMS and our <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_faq">APIs</a> to a wide range of users and services, with one example being the United States Library of Congress, which archives Tweets for historical purposes. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>

                                    <p><b>Cookies:</b> {% blocktrans %}Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Tribus may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>

                                    <p><b>Log Data:</b> {% blocktrans %}Our servers automatically record information ("<strong>Log Data</strong>") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our website, sign into our Services or interact with our email notifications. Tribus uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them.</p>
