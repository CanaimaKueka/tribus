Description: Software implementation of the OpenAL API (shared library)
 OpenAL, the Open Audio Library, is a joint effort to create an open,
 vendor-neutral, cross-platform API for interactive, primarily spatialized
 audio. OpenAL's primary audience are application developers and desktop
 users that rely on portable standards like OpenGL, for games and other
 multimedia applications.
 .
 This library is meant as a compatible update/replacement to the OpenAL Sample
 Implementation (the SI). The SI has been unmaintained for quite a while, and
 would require a lot of work to clean up. This is a fork the old Windows version
 to attempt an accelerated ALSA version of an OpenAL implementation.
 .
 OpenAL Soft supports mono, stereo, 4-channel, 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 output, as
 opposed to the SI's 4-channel max (though it did have some provisions for 6
 channel, this was not 5.1, and was seemingly a "late" addition). OpenAL Soft
 does not support the Vorbis and MP3 extensions, however those were considered
 deprecated even in the SI. It does, though, support some of the newer
 extensions like AL_EXT_FLOAT32 and AL_EXT_MCFORMATS for multi-channel and
 floating-point formats, as well as ALC_EXT_EFX for environmental audio effects,
 and others.
 .
 This package installs the OpenAL Soft shared library.
