django_notify
=============

*This is a work in progress*
----------------------------

This application should live outside django-wiki. 
It will! But only as soon as there's time to package it separately...

TODO:

 * Missing email functionality
 * Functions to easily retrive notifications and mark them as read
 * Some easy-to-use template tags and templates to override.
 * Examples of how to extend
