  (can be disabled by configuration)
- Exchanges can be moderated (with auto-accept and auto-reject plug-ins)
- Optional recipient filter plug-ins
- Optional exchange filtering plug-ins (blacklists)
- Multi-recipient writing is possible (can be disabled by configuration)
  with min/max constraints
- Messages are managed by conversations
- Messages in folders are sortable by sender|recipient|subject|date
- 'Archives' folder in addition to classic Inbox, Sent and Trash folders
- A Quick-Reply form to only ask for a response text

It has support for optional additional applications:
- Autocomplete recipient field (default is 'django-ajax-selects'),
  with multiple recipient management
