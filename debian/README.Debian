Aguilas for Debian
------------------

Aguilas configuration is stored in /etc/aguilas/config.php. You
can change it with any text editor, and remember that after this you do
not need to restart the webserver.

If you want to go through debconf questions again after the package has been
installed, please remove the configuration file /etc/aguilas/config.php
before running `dpkg-reconfigure aguilas`.
